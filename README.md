# Ros bag extractor

Extracts messages from .bag files using rosbag python code API.

Currently some ROS packages (e.g. cv_bridge) have limited support of python3, so
python2 is used. TODO: could be rewritten with C++ API.

## Usage

1. Install requirements
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Run ```python main.py --path <path_to_your_bag_file>```
